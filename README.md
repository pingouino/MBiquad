# MBiquad
Biquad object implementation in Matlab. 

This class helps calculate the biquad coefficient filter of order 2n (low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, peak, lowshelf, highshelf) and process data by block of samples using the transposed structure of direct transform 2.

A basic example is provided to demonstrate the use of the class.
